Please read /docs/design to understand the assumptions taken and class tree structure 

# note
This program uses random generation of roll dice, which can lead to almost infinite loop, so there's a kill switch by number of rounds

## usage 
- look for makefile for specific test cases running 

- run `make test_all` for all the values being played
